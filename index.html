	<h1>Part One the Void,children And The Man In The Wall</h1>

	</p>First we need to talk about the Orokin. they had destoryed there solar system in wars with infested and an ally of there making the Sentients, (remember the Sentients its going to pop out a little bit later!) so in last effort they sent the 10-zaramen
ship into the once unknown The Void. it failed the Void jump, and went into this state in-between a half like state, people went crazy. (only the aduts for some reason) They were not alone. An entity The Man In The Walls made them what the kids call warp minded, he 
comadened them to hunt the children and so they did. But the children where not defenceless, the Void Radiation had made the children gainied powers heres the list
Void Energy Manipulation
Transference
Void Invisibility and Intangibility
Void Dash/Sling
Void Blast
Resurrection and Immortality
most of the adults where killed by the kids and some killed themselves nontheless the ship was recoverd with only the powerful kids standing.
